Kaching!
========

Monitoring should be fun! When a new project goes live we want immediate
feedback.

Kaching aims to be a general-purpose dashboard/extreme-feedback-device that can
be used to display useful development metrics, such as build-status,
commit-log, coverage-metrics; along with various motivational production
metrics, such as "how much money we've made today", "how many sales we've made"


Planned Widgets
---------------
* Extreme feedback widget (big green/red box)
* Commit log (with Git/SVN adapter)
* Revenue
* Various sound-effects that can be triggered via HTTP. (hence Kaching!)
